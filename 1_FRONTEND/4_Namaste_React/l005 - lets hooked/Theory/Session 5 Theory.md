## Q: What is the difference between `Named export`, `Default export`, and `* as export`?
A: ES6 provides us to import & export a module and use it in other files. ES6 provides two ways to export a module from a file: `named export` and `default export`.
In `Named export`, one can have multiple named exports per file. Then import the specific exports they want surrounded in `{}` braces. The name of imported module has to be the same as the name of the exported module.
In `Named export`, the component is exported from MyComponent.js file like:
```
export const MyComponent = () => {}
export const MyComponent2 = () => {}
``` 
and the component is imported from MyComponent.js file like: here we must use `{}` in MyComponent.
```
// ex. importing a single named export
import { MyComponent } from "./MyComponent";

// ex. importing multiple named exports
import { MyComponent, MyComponent2 } from "./MyComponent";

// ex. giving a named import a different name by using "as":
import { MyComponent2 as MyNewComponent } from "./MyComponent";
```

In `Default export`, One can have only one default export per file. The naming of import is completely independent in default export and we can use any name we like.
In `Default export`, the component is exported from MyComponent.js file like:
```
const MyComponent = () => {}
export default MyComponent;
```
and the component is imported from MyComponent.js file like: here we must omit `{}` in MyComponent.
```
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";
```

In `* as export`, it is used to import the whole module as a component and access the components inside the module.
In `* as export`, the component is exported from MyComponent.js file like:
```
export const MyComponent = () => {}
export const MyComponent2 = () => {}
export const MyComponent3 = () => {}
``` 
and the component is imported from MyComponent.js file like:
```
import * as MainComponents from "./MyComponent";
```
Now we can use them in JSX as:
```
<MainComponents.MyComponent />
<MainComponents.MyComponent2 />
<MainComponents.MyComponent3 />
```
We can use `Named export` and `Default export` together. So you should export like:
```
export const MyComponent2 = () => {}
const MyComponent = () => {}
export default MyComponent;
```
and import like:
```
import MyComponent, {MyComponent2} from "./MyComponent";
```


## Q: What is the importance of `config.js` file?
A: `config.js` files are essentially editable text files that contain information required for the successful oper ation of a program. The files are structured in a particular way, formatted to be user configurable.
Most of the computer programs we use: whether office suites, web browsers, even video games are configured via menu interfaces.
Configuration files are very simple in structure. For instance, if you were to write an application, and the only thing it ever needed to know was its user's preferred name, then its one and only config file could contain exactly one word: the name of the user. For example:
```
Chetan
```
Usually, though, an application needs to keep track of more than just one piece of information, so configuration often uses a key and a value:
```
NAME='Chetan'
SURNAME='Nada'
```

## Q: What are `React Hooks`?
A:  `React Hooks` provide a way to use state and other React features without writing a class. 
They make it easier to manage data that can change over time (state) and side effects in React applications. 
With Hooks, you can create reusable and easy-to-understand components, which can lead to more maintainable and efficient code.

Hooks are used to:

`Manage State`: Hooks like useState allow you to add and manage state variables within functional components. 
State allows you to keep track of data that can change over time, and Hooks make it simple to handle this state within functional components.

`Use Lifecycle Methods`: Hooks like useEffect allow you to perform side effects in functional components. 
Side effects could include fetching data from an API, subscribing to events, or cleaning up resources when a component unmounts.

`Reusability and Composability`: Hooks enable you to create custom reusable hooks that encapsulate logic and can be shared across different components. 
This promotes code reusability and composability.


## Q: Why do we need `useState Hook`?
A: `useState hook` is used to maintain the state in our React application. It keeps track of the state changes so basically useState has the ability to encapsulate local state in a functional component.
The  useState hook is a special function that takes the `initial state` as an `argument` and `returns an array` of two entries.  UseState encapsulate only singular value from the state, for multiple state need to have useState calls.
#### Syntax for useState hook
```
const [state, setState] = useState(initialstate);
```
#### Importing: To use useState you need to import useState from react as shown below:
```
import React, { useState } from "react";
```
we can use Hooks in Functional Components
```
const Example = (props) => {
  // You can use Hooks here!
  return <div />;
}
```
